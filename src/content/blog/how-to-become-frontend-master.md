## Difference from OPEN-AI:

1.Small model with strong performance
2.Cheap. 
3.Can be deployed locally
4.Customizability. 
5.Data security. 
6.Free of copyright problem.

## List of other start-ups doing similar things:
1.Cyberagent
2.Rinna
3.Retrieva

## Difference from other start-ups:

- Base-Models are different
we plan to use Bloom and chatGLM(Trained by Tsinghua University) MOOS(Trained by FuDan University). Bloom is good at multi-lingual tasks. Models trained in Chinese may be transfered to Japanese tasks conveniently with high performance.
- Application Senarios are different.
1.Publisher (translation) company whose books are mainly digests and combinations of exsited materials.
2.administrative scrivener officeã€€or other offices whose documents are also easy to be composed by generative AI.
- Utilize  model decompositon techniques
These techniques can give the model fine explainability, while the cost is lower than full training.
The cost is approximately 2 million yen (cost of a HPC (with GPU*4)).
Fine-Tuning with cloud GPU in AWS/GCP is about 80,000 yen. Already tested.

## the next step is finishing prototype in application scenario(publisher) 
It will take a while. 
Then we can perfect the prototype to a python package. At least finish all skeletons of the package.

## Compute the develop cost, initial cost, running cost
